# 100DaysOfJavaScript

_This is a challenge I made to motivate myself to learn Vanilla JavaScript._

_I started a couple of weeks ago with JavaScript Fundamentals (data types, operators, structures of control, and the basic of functions, arrays and objects). I didn't record that, but I'll do it from the DOM._

I use this course as reference: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

### Day 20

Learned about Short Circuiting (&& and ||), and about the Nullish Coalescing Operator (??). I also learned about the Logical assignment operator and made a Challenge gathering from destructuring until these topics.

### Day 19

Learning about spread operator and rest pattern/parameter. How these work in a different way (opposite way), and how Javascript recognize which one you are calling depends where you use it.

### Day 18

Learning about destructuring. Destructuring arrays and objects, why we use this and some advices.


### Days 14 - 17

Small but good E-commerce project where I put on practice everything I've learned so far. There is a small bug, but as soon as I find how to fix it I'll be better. The web runs well, the bug is minimun. 
Concepts: Data types, Functions, If Statements, For Loops, DOM, Event Listeners, and more! 
I also had the opportunity of improving my HTML and CSS skills a bit.  

### Day 13

Today I have started one small project (Shopping Cart) to put in the reps the knowledge I've adquired so far.

### Day 12

Understanding better how primitive and reference types work behind the scenes, how the call stack and the heap temporary store this values temporarily. Also how to create shallow copies of our objects with the 'Object.assign({}, objectToCopy1, objectToCopy2, ..., objectToCopyN)' method. 

I am ready to create some small projects in order to gather some concepts I've learned so far. I think it is the best way to keep this in my long-term memory.

### Day 11

Learning about the this keyword, how dynamic this variable is and the different values it can take. I also  learned about the values that the 'this' keyword can take depending on where is called from, how can we use it throughout the different sort od functions, and more.

### Day 10

Theory and Practice of Hoisting and TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone).

### Day 9

Scoping in practice, writing code to understand better how the different scopes work.

### Day 8

Understanding concepts like Scope and Scoping Chain, vs Call Stack.

### Day 7

Learning more concepts about Execution Context and the Call Stack to understand better how JS works. I HAVE TO COME BACK HERE IN A FUTURE SEVERAL TIMES UNTILL FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPTS.

### Day 6

Learning concepts such as JavaScript Engine and Runtime to understand how this high level programming language works behind the scenes.

### Day 5

Today I finish my 3rd small project learning more about the DOM and I knew more class properties to make my program more insteresting.
I am ready to create my own small projects with everything I've learned about Javascript so far.

### Day 4

Praticing about "event listener" with the Pig-Game Project. A bit tired for my day job, but on my way.

### DAY 3

Today I started a project following along the course to reinforce what I've been learning about the DOM.

### DAY 2

Today I've been learning more about the DOM with another interesting project. In this case I worked with classes (adding and removing them), learning more about the eventListener (today about keypress event).

### DAY 1

I learned about the DOM basic with a project as example. I added some code from me using what I understood and the refactored it a little bit.
