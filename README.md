# 100DaysOfJavaScript
*This is a challenge I made to motivate myself to learn Vanilla JavaScript.*

*I started a couple of weeks ago with JavaScript Fundamentals (data types, operators, structures of control, and the basic of functions, arrays and objects). I didn't record that, but I'll do it from the DOM.* 

I use this course as reference: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

### DAY 1
I learned about the DOM basic with a project as example. I added some code from me using what I understood and the refactored it a little bit.
