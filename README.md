# 100DaysOfJavaScript

_This is a challenge I made to motivate myself to learn Vanilla JavaScript._

_I started a couple of weeks ago with JavaScript Fundamentals (data types, operators, structures of control, and the basic of functions, arrays and objects). I didn't record that, but I'll do it from the DOM._

I use this course as reference: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/

### Day 7

Learning more concepts about Execution Context and the Call Stack to understand better how JS works. I HAVE TO COME BACK HERE IN A FUTURE SEVERAL TIMES UNTILL FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPTS.

### Day 6

Learning concepts such as JavaScript Engine and Runtime to understand how this high level programming language works behind the scenes.

### Day 5

Today I finish my 3rd small project learning more about the DOM and I knew more class properties to make my program more insteresting.
I am ready to create my own small projects with everything I've learned about Javascript so far.

### Day 4

Praticing about "event listener" with the Pig-Game Project. A bit tired for my day job, but on my way.

### DAY 3

Today I started a project following along the course to reinforce what I've been learning about the DOM.

### DAY 2

Today I've been learning more about the DOM with another interesting project. In this case I worked with classes (adding and removing them), learning more about the eventListener (today about keypress event).

### DAY 1

I learned about the DOM basic with a project as example. I added some code from me using what I understood and the refactored it a little bit.
